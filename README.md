# AI-Writing-Survey

This repository contains anonymised survey data about how students use AI in academic writing.

- The survey has been repeated across multiple cohorts.
- Each response is tagged with an `initial_year` field (e.g. 2023, 2024, 2025), so all cohorts are stored in a **single JSON file**.
- Data files live in `data/`, visualisations in `graphs/`.

The data are intended as a companion dataset for research on students' attitudes toward AI-assisted writing and academic integrity.
